    "What is Energy?\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical description of energy is the ability of a system to perform work, but as energy exists in so many forms, it is hard to find one comprehensive definition. It is the property of an object that can be transferred from one object to another or converted to different forms but cannot be created or destroyed. There are numerous sources of energy. In the next few sections, let us discuss the about different sources of energy in detail.\n",
    "Sources Of Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Sources of energy can be classified into:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Renewable Sources\n",
    "    Non-renewable Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Renewable sources of energy are available plentiful in nature and are sustainable. These resources of energy can be naturally replenished and are safe for the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of renewable sources of energy are: Solar energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass, hydropower and tidal energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-renewable resource is a natural resource that is found underneath the earth. These type of energy resources do not replenish at the same speed at which it is used. They take millions of years to replenish. The main examples of non-renewable resources are coal, oil and natural gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of non-renewable sources of energy are: Natural gas, coal, petroleum, nuclear energy and hydrocarbon gas liquids.\n",
    "Sources Of Energy\n",
    "Difference Between Renewable and Non-renewable Sources of Energy\n",
    "Renewable \tNon-renewable\n",
    "The resources that can be renewed once they are consumed are called renewable sources of energy. \tThe resources that cannot be renewed once they are consumed are called non-renewable sources of energy.\n",
    "These resources do not cause any environmental pollution. \tThese resources cause environmental pollution..\n",
    "Renewable resources are inexhaustible. \tNon- Renewable resources are exhaustible.\n",
    "Renewable resources are not affected by human activities. \tNon- Renewable resources are affected by human activities.\n",
    "Examples of Renewable resources- Air, water and solar energy. \tExamples of Non-renewable resources- natural gas, coal and nuclear energy.\n",
    "Natural Sources of Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "During the stone age, it was wood. During the iron age, we had coal. In the modern age, we have fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas. So how do we choose the source of energy?\n",
    "Good sources of energy should have the following qualities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Optimum heat production per unit of volume/mass used\n",
    "    Easy to transport\n",
    "    Least Polluting\n",

    "    Non-Conventional Sources of Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference Between Conventional and Non-Conventional Sources of Energy\n",
    " Conventional \t Non-conventional\n",
    "These resources are exhaustible. \tThese resources are inexhaustible.\n",
    "These resources cause pollution as they emit smoke and ash. \tThese resources are usually pollution-free.\n",
    "These resources are very expensive to be maintained, stored and transmitted. \tThese resources are less expensive for local use and can easily be maintained.\n",
    "Examples- coal, natural gas, petroleum, and water power. \tExamples- solar, biomass, wind, biogas, and tidal, geothermal.\n",

    "A nuclear reactor, or power plant, is a series of machines that can control nuclear fission to produce electricity. The fuel that nuclear reactors use to produce nuclear fission is pellets of the element uranium. In a nuclear reactor, atoms of uranium are forced to break apart. As they split, the atoms release tiny particles called fission products. Fission products cause other uranium atoms to split, starting a chain reaction. The energy released from this chain reaction creates heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heat created by nuclear fission warms the reactor's cooling agent. A cooling agent is usually water, but some nuclear reactors use liquid metal or molten salt. The cooling agent, heated by nuclear fission, produces steam. The steam turns turbines, or wheels turned by a flowing current. The turbines drive generators, or engines that create electricity.\n",

Nuclear poisons are materials, such as a type of the element xenon, that absorb some of the fission products created by nuclear fission.

Removing the rods will allow a stronger chain reaction and create more electricity.\n",

U-235 makes up less than one percent of the uranium in the world.\n",

    "Although some of the uranium the United States uses is mined in this country, most is imported. The U.S. gets uranium from Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan. Once uranium is mined, it must be extracted from other minerals. It must also be processed before it can be used.\n",

Radioactive material can be extremely toxic, causing burns and increasing the risk for cancers, blood diseases, and bone decay.\n",

Whether it’s gas, oil, or coal, the rising costs forced many facilities worldwide to cut their energy expenses. This is a good moment to start questioning facility power consumption and find where the energy is going, because for many businesses, increasing of energy bills and doing nothing about it usually means closing.An important initial step in evaluating energy saving opportunities is to estimate The contribution to peak billing demand, and the amount of energy consumption. Of each major load or process within the facility being evaluated.Generally, the facility energy profile helps to focus the energy optimization efforts on those processes or loads that have the most savings potential. This profile also may identify batch processes or discretionary loads that may be scheduled at times of low demand for the rest of the facility, or during times of off-peak utility prices.This fact would suggest that the meter measuring the power consumption of a feeder serving the building’s centrifugal water chillers.An example of the facility energy profile looks like this:Actual power monitoring data from existing circuit monitors measuring the power consumption of individual feeders is the best basis for establishing the Facility Energy ProfileFigure 1 – Power monitoring of existing circuitsLet’s start the discussion with defining demand analysis techniques, demand controls systems, optimizing the demand savings associated with generator operation, lighting control and later with optimizing electric motors, VSDs, compressed air, an so on.Table of Contents:Demand analysis is the methodology used to determine if there are opportunities for a given facility to reduce peak demand charges. Demand analysis involves manipulation of historical demand interval data to determine:The demand sort is produced by rearranging individual integrated demand readings for a given billing period. Meters record demand readings chronologically, 3000 or so readings for a 30-day billing period at 15-minute demand intervals; the demand sort utilizes a software tool to distribute the readings from highest to lowest, so that times and values of peak usage are easily analyzed.Figure 2 – Energy demand statisticsFigure 4 shows the demand sort table facilitates demand analysis by depicting the number of intervals (or hours) during which the plant’s peak electrical demand exceeded certain levels.Figure 3 – The demand sort tableUsing the demand sort table, the engineer is able to determine that a reduction in peak demand to 2200 kW at this example facility would have required a demand reduction of 122 kW for 25 15-minute intervals, or 6.25 hours, in August of the sample year.Figure 4 – An example of reduction in peak demand to 2200 kWFacility Peak-Day load profiles from actual power monitoring data can show consistency, or, as in this case, a single-day aberration in peak demand that set the demand minimum billing level (ratchet) for the remainder of the year.Figure 5 – Facility Peak-Day load profileGo back to the Contents Table ↑Demand controls systems are available that perform the following basic functions:These demand controls systems are intended to reduce peak demand for a facility to some predetermined level. The design engineer’s foremost demand control system challenge is to identify loads in the facility that can be controlled effectively.Ideal load candidates includes those machines or processes that are currently contributing to the facility’s load at peak times, and whose function can be delayed or curtailed at times of peak.\\xa0Most facilities lack equipment or processes that fit this ideal description, despite the numerous machines and processes that may be operating at peak times.In fact, successful demand control is usually the exception rather than the rule!One common candidate for the demand control system is the air conditioning system. Buildings equipped with multiple packaged direct-expansion air conditioning systems are typical targets of demand control sales efforts. Unfortunately, demand control of air conditioning compressors usually leads to loss of temperature or humidity control within the conditioned space, or lack of demand savings.Secondly, basic thermodynamic principles of moist air and vapor-compression refrigeration systems require compressor power consumption to reduce air temperature and condense moisture. This process is controlled by thermostats and humidistats within the facility. When cooling or dehumidification is removed or reduced at times when these devices are “calling for” them, temperature and humidity will rise in the conditioned space.So, if not air conditioning equipment, what loads have been successful demand control candidates?An electrolysis process providing chemicals for a paper mill was able to reduce peak demand and flatten the demand profile for the overall facility. A battery-charging system for forklift vehicles in an automotive facility was capable of producing real demand savings during peak times.Finally, a large induction furnace melting scrap metal proved to be an effective candidate for the rolling mill at a steel plant.Figure below shows how chilled water supply and return temperatures increase over the course of a day due to demand control of inlet guide vanes on a centrifugal water chiller. Space conditions could not be maintained as a result of the demand control.Figure 6 – Chilled water supply and return temperatures increaseGo back to the Contents Table ↑How, the engineer might ask, can a facility save money by burning fossil fuel in an onsite generator at a unit cost of 12 ¢/kWh, when the average unit cost of utility purchased power is 8 ¢/kWh? Very carefully, is the expected – and accurate – response.The key to economical peak shaving is to understand and optimize the demand savings associated with generator operation. That is, the onsite generator must be operated the absolute minimum time necessary to reduce peak demand the maximum amount. Because the overall average unit price of electricity is not necessarily equivalent to the effective price of electricity at the plant’s peak.For the facility with a sharp demand peak, when the peak for the month is set in a few hours or less and the remainder of the time demand is low, peak-shaving at 12 ¢/kWh can be preferable to paying 20 ¢/kWh.Go back to the Contents Table ↑Onsite generators typically utilize natural gas, wood, fuel oil, or steam derived from a fossil fuel or as a part of a production process. Unit fuel costs for fossil fuels are usually calculated based on the fuel’s heating value, an estimated efficiency of the generator system, and the fuel cost.Cost/kWh = fuel price/gal × 3413/HV/efficiencyIn this equation, HV is the heating value of fuel oil in BTU/gal, and 3413 is the conversion from BTU to kWh. Internal combustion diesel generators typically range in efficiency from 25-30%.For a typical example, #2 fuel oil may be burned in an IC engine. For a fuel-oil price of $2.00/gal, and a generator efficiency of 25%, the fuel cost/kWh is:Obviously, peak-shaving is much less attractive at a fuel cost of $2.00/gal, unless required generator operation can be predicted accurately and electricity charges are comparably high as well.Go back to the Contents Table ↑Electric utility rates must be analyzed carefully prior to implementing peak shaving or cogeneration opportunities. Some utilities have special interconnection and protective relaying requirements to ensure that onsite generation does not pose a safety hazard for utility workers.In addition, many utility rate schedules impose standby charges for onsite generation.Facilities with onsite generation may be able to operate this equipment to reduce purchased power requirements during periods of high demand, or high utility prices.Figure 7 – Reducing purchased power requirements with onsite generationFigure below shows how savings or losses associated with operation of peak-shaving generators are dependent on fuel prices, on-peak electricity prices, the amount of time the generator has to operate for a given peak-reduction target, and, most importantly, the accuracy with which plant personnel can predict these variables.Figure 8 – Savings or losses are associated with operation of peak-shaving generatorsElectricity generation and peak shaving can also be accomplished with steam cogeneration systems typical of paper mills, refineries, and other large industrial processes.Figure 9 – Steam cogeneration system diagramGo back to the Contents Table ↑Lighting systems in industrial facilities can represent an attractive savings opportunity, especially if lighting systems have not been upgraded or maintained in the past ten years. The most cost-effective approach for lighting energy savings is to address the following three issues, in order:The second priority in lighting conservation involves light level reductions. The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (www.iesna.org) has established recommended light levels for different types of work tasks and area usage types.Light output of a fixture is usually published in lumens. Many manufacturers of lamps and lighting systems offer software tools to aid in designing new systems, or in evaluating changes to existing systems.Suggested Course – Ultimate Course To Electrical Drawings Design Using AutoCAD, DiaLUX & ETAPUltimate Course To Electrical Drawings Design Using AutoCAD, DiaLUX and ETAP SoftwareGo back to the Contents Table ↑While “turn-off-the-light” programs have been widely utilized in all types of facilities, sophisticated lighting control systems have proven to be much more cost-effective. Certainly, it’s cheaper to have a worker turn off a light, but workers forget, workers may not have access to circuit breakers controlling large banks of industrial lighting fixtures, those same circuit breakers are not designed for daily operation as light switches, and so on.Lighting system controls that utilize microprocessors and specially-designed remote-operated circuit breakers are much more effective. These devices can be programmed to accommodate complicated shift configurations, including nights, weekends, and holidays. They also include simple over-ride features for temporary or unusual work schedules.For example, Powerlink MVP Intelligent lighting panel (by Schneider Electric) utilizes patented technology to control lighting circuits, and offers Transparent Ready web-based monitoring and controlFigure 10 – Powerlink MVP Intelligent lighting panel (by Schneider Electric)Go back to the Contents Table ↑Several factors contribute to this decline. Lamps, including fluorescent and high-intensity discharge sources like high-pressure sodium and metal halide, experience Lamp Lumen Depreciation (LLD). The LLD is typically less than 1.0, indicating that average lamp light output at some point in the future is less than light output of a new lamp.Light levels are also adversely affect by dirt and the accumulation of dust on the light fixture. Luminaire Dirt Depreciation (LDD), also a factor less than 1.0, is a function of the type of light fixture as well as the environment in which the fixture operates.Ballast Factor, or BF, is yet another commonly used factor. BF is also a published value that is a function of the type of ballast used to control the arc characteristics of fluorescent and HID lighting systems.The designer usually applies these factors to the rated light level output of a lighting system, in order to estimate the number of fixtures required to provide the desired light level – not at initial installation, rather at some designated point in the future. For example,# fixtures = total required lumens/initial lumens/fixture/(LLD * LDD * BF)Suggested Course – Electrical Designing and Drafting CourseElectrical Designing and Drafting Course (Part 1)Go back to the Contents Table ↑Manufacturers publish the “rated life” expectancy of a given lamp. This value, usually given in thousands of hours, is not a guarantee that every lamp will extinguish at the same rated-life time. In fact, the “rated life” is a statistical value indicating the point at which half of the lamps of a representative sample will burn out. Some lamps will fail well shy of the rated life; others may last beyond the rated life.The facility’s lamp replacement practices usually fall into one of two categories:Group replacement runs counter to common sense for most people – if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. That’s why spot replacement is the most common practice by far. There is, however, a sound reason for considering the group-replacement strategy: Economics.Fewer light fixtures means lower energy costs attributable to lighting, and less heat for the building’s air conditioning system. Labor costs have also been shown to be lower for group replacement as compared to spot replacement. Group replacement can be scheduled to occur during unoccupied times; set up and take down costs are reduced; the cost per lamp itself can be lower with large-quantity purchases.Suggested Course – AC Distribution Panel Drawings: Single-Line Diagrams, Wirings & Interlocking SchematicsLearn AC Distribution Panel Drawings: Single-Line Diagrams, Wirings, and Interlocking SchematicsGo back to the Contents Table ↑Three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors comprise a considerable percentage of the electrical load in the United States. Design, operation, and maintenance of these machines is well described in other references; this document focuses on their energy efficiency aspects.Induction motors typically range in full load efficiency from about 87% to 94%. This efficiency is very difficult to measure accurately in the field, requiring a dynamometer and other specialized equipment. Fortunately, energy saving projects associated with electric motors do not require actual efficiency of a given motor to be established.One of the foremost opportunities for energy savings is to implement a program of replacing – rather than rewinding – induction motors at failure. Rewinding a damaged induction motor is a common practice in industry, but studies have proven that rewinding an induction motor drops its efficiency by a couple percentage points.The incremental cost of replacing this failed motor with an energy-efficient motor, however, is only $430. This amount assumes considers the rewound cost, and the labor necessary to perform the motor change-out, as sunk costs.The annual energy savings associated with replacing the failed motor with an energy-efficient model, at a new efficiency of 92.9%, is approximately $510. The simple payback for the replacement, therefore, is less than one year.Energy-efficient motor programs are applicable to any AC motor installations utilizing NEMA Design B induction motors. Since the programs are based on replacement at failure, the full savings potential is realized after three years or more.Table 1 – Published efficiencies of typical rewound, standard, and energy-efficient three-phase induction motors.Figure 11 – Electric motors are efficient machines, even at partial loadFigure 12 – But power factor drops off sharply at half loadSuggested Course – The Essentials of Rotating Electrical Machines: AC & DC Electric Motors and GeneratorsThe Essentials of Rotating Electrical Machines: AC & DC Electric Motors and GeneratorsGo back to the Contents Table ↑There are many devices used to provide AC motor control – starting, stopping, changing speed, varying torque, providing protection from voltage and current anomalies. This section will focus, however, on variable-frequency control devices designed to reduce energy consumption and improve operation of three-phase AC induction motors.Table 2 – Four major categories of AC motor loadsEnergy-saving opportunities commonly focus on the variable-torque category, because the energy saving potential is large even with small changes in pump or fan speed control. This opportunity is driven by the power and speed characteristics of the variable-torque load. The capacity of a pump or fan is directly proportional to the speed. A change in speed of 10% yields a change in pump gpm or fan CFM of 10%.Brake horsepower, however, is proportionally to the cube of the speed, meaning that a 10% reduction in pump or fan speed can yield a 27% reduction in power consumption.Since most pumps and fans are driven by fixed-speed electric motors, where speed of the driven load is determined by the number of motor poles, AC frequency, and motor slip, varying the speed of a motor requires an external device. This external device is commonly referred to as an adjustable-speed drive, variable-frequency drive, inverter, vector drive, or adjustable-frequency controller.Figure 13 – Variable-torque loads, such as centrifugal pumps and fans, exhibit a cubic relationship between brake horsepower and speedSuggested Reading – Inside Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) PanelInside Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) Panel: Configuration, Schematics and TroubleshootingGo back to the Contents Table ↑Compressed air systems can consume a significant amount of electric energy in an industrial facility. Many textile, automotive, chemical, and petroleum facilities operate large, multi-stage air compressors driven by electric motors representing hundreds, thousands, or even ten-thousands of horsepower in capacity.One chemical plant providing raw materials for synthetic textile manufacturing operated one 22,000 hp, and two 8,000 hp compressors in a portion of its process. While the 22,000 hp compressor is rare, significant energy reduction opportunities associated with compressed are available.Power consumption of a typical air compressor is a function of the air volume required (V), the inlet air temperature (Tin), and the required pressure rise (Pout/Pin)These opportunities may include:Compressor discharge pressure in some facilities is set too high. Since the pressure rise across a compressor is a key factor in its power consumption, reducing outlet pressure can offer significant savings. Some reasons for excessive pressure may be straightforward; eg, production equipment with lower requirements has replaced older machines without a corresponding reduction in compressed air setpoint.Other reasons may be more complex; eg, piping system losses or leaks may force higher setpoints at the compressors in order to provide adequate air pressure at production equipment.Compressed air leaks usually offer the most attractive opportunity for reducing compressed air volume. Some facilities have ignored leaks to the point that one compressor is effectively operating 24/7 simply to serve air leaks.Suggested Reading – Energy-efficiency opportunities in compressed air systemsEleven energy-efficiency improvement opportunities in compressed air systemsWarm air is less dense than cold air. As the compressed air work equation above indicates, reducing inlet air temperature can reduce the work associated with a compressor. The usual method of reducing air temperature is to provide outside air intakes for the compressor, rather than allowing the compressor to utilize air from a hot equipment room.It’s common to assume that inlet pressure to a compressor is fixed at atmospheric pressure, but this is a misconception. Air compressor inlet systems, especially air filters, need to be kept clean and free of obstructions. Pressure drop across dirty or blocked intakes serves to reduce the pressure at the compressor and increase power consumption.Multi-stage air compressors, equipped with inter- and after-coolers to optimize efficiency and provide heat recovery, are common in industrial facilities.Figure 14 – Multi-stage air compressors, equipped with inter- and after-coolersGo back to the Contents Table ↑Figure 15 – Centrifugal water chillers in Dubai World Trade Center chiller plantLarge commercial and industrial electrical loads are largely made up of centrifugal water chillers. Because of their efficiency, these machines typically produce cooling effects that are two to three times greater than the energy input needed. In the 1980s, centrifugal water systems were the subject of CFC legislation, which led to the replacement or refurbishment of many of these devices. But there are still chances for chiller optimization.One opportunity is to alter the operational plan for numerous chillers that share a chilled water header. These machines are typically staged so that none are loaded above 80% of their rated capacity. This tactic evolved as a result of the machines’ part-load efficiencies, which tended to produce a U-shaped efficiency curve.The curve showed that between 60% and 80% of full load was where efficiency was at its highest.The typical chiller efficiency curve is shaped like an u, with the peak efficiency occurring between 60% and 80% of full load. However, at full load, chillers serving industrial loads have their highest measured efficiency.Figure 16 – Typical chiller efficiency curveFigure 17 – Operating three chillers at partial loads is less efficient that operating two chillers at or near their rated capacityOther successful strategies for chiller optimization include:Optimization #1 – Chilled water resetIn order to adapt this strategy to the needs of the cooling load, the chilled water supply temperature setpoint must be raised. An automatic chiller controller’s control routines frequently include reset as a step. Resetting a compressor with chilled water can cut power usage by 1.5% to 2% per degree.Optimization #2 – Reduce condenser water temperatureSimilar to raising the chilled water setpoint, reducing the condenser water temperature serves to reduce the compressor power requirements. Condenser water temperature reduction of one degree can reduce compressor power consumption by 0.5%-1%.Optimization #3 – Monitor and maintain chiller approach temperaturesChiller condensers and evaporators are shell-and-tube heat exchangers that require periodic maintenance to maintain optimum heat transfer characteristics.Annual average readings of condenser approach temperature (difference in temperature between condenser water and refrigerant in shell-and-tube heat exchanger) gradually crept up from the initial design value of 6 F to nearly 15 F over three years.Figure 18 – Annual average readings of condenser approach temperatureFigure 19 – Increase in condenser tube fouling can have a significant adverse effect on compressor power consumptionGo back to the Contents Table ↑HVAC systems should be the focus of a targeted energy study, with similar objectives as the lighting analysis:Go back to the Contents Table ↑Table 3 – Checklist and optimization proposal for lightingTable 4 – Checklist and optimization proposal for induction motorsTable 5 – Checklist and optimization proposal for demand managementTable 6 – Checklist and optimization proposal for exhaust, ventilation & pneumatic conveyingTable 7 – Checklist and optimization proposal for fan-coil unit air handling unitsTable 8 – Checklist and optimization proposal for centrifugal water chillersTable 9 – Checklist and optimization proposal for cooling towersTable 10 – Checklist and optimization proposal for boilersTable 11 – Checklist and optimization proposal for heat recoveryTable 12 – Checklist and optimization proposal for cogenerationTable 13 – Checklist and optimization proposal for refrigerationTable 14 – Checklist and optimization proposal for compressed airGo back to the Contents Table ↑Suggested Courses – ETAP Power System Design BundleETAP Power System Design Bundle: Analysis, Protection and Coordination, Motor Acceleration and ModelingSource: Electrical Energy Management by Bill Brown, P.E.; Schneider Electric', 'https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/facilities-optimize-power-consumption-hiking-energy-prices'], 'Better protection system for distribution networks with distributed energy resources': ['Existing distribution feeders and their integrated protection systems are not designed for high penetration of renewable energy (RE) based distributed energy resources (DERs). The overcurrent protection systems are designed considering the passive, unidirectional current flow. However, integration of the RE based DERs such as PV systems through power electronic inverter interfaces fundamentally changes the distribution network from passive to active network with bidirectional current flow.The increased use of inverter interfaced RE based DERs and loads will result in increased harmonic injection affecting power quality. Moreover, increased penetration of RE based DERs will reduce the level of fault current magnitude from the feeder substation source.This will adversely affect the feeder protection system to provide effective protection as the fault current could fall below the overcurrent threshold.Faults in power systems (both in AC and DC systems) are inevitable and will occur at one time or another. Certain fault types, such as high impedance faults (HIF) in AC systems generate low fault current magnitude as opposed to high fault current magnitude from common short circuit faults which renders the feeder overcurrent (OC) protection mechanism ineffective in HIF detection.Figure 1 – Radial distribution feeder with PV system DERsThese types of faults must be detected and isolated as they can cause fire hazards and increase the risk of electrocution. The inherent difficulty in HIF detection using OC protection scheme in medium- (MV) to low voltage (LV) where HIFs are a common occurrence can be aggravated by penetration of RE based DERs.HIF detection and classification based on feature extraction rather than simply using current magnitude as a metric for HIF detection will fail. This is due to low fault current magnitude from HIFs and moreover, increased penetration of RE based DERs reduces the fault current magnitude.As the accuracy and speed of convergence of conventional FFT and WT rely on the periodicity of the fault current and voltage, their effectiveness under DC offset and HIFs are limited. Moreover, most DC-offset suppression techniques utilise parameter estimation and can add additional computational delay.Fault protection systems in DC distribution are at their infancy as compared to the fault protection systems in AC distribution. Faults in DC systems including the DC side of the PV system exhibit characteristics quite different from the AC system generally because of different voltage (V) and current (I) characteristics in DC systems.DC systems generally suffer from short circuit as well as open circuit faults resulting from the mechanical separation of conductors, and in most cases resulting in sustained arcing. An overcurrent protection strategy using current magnitude as a threshold metric is applied for all types of faults in the DC power systems including PV systems.Figure 2 – Typical radial distribution feeder with PV penetrationHowever, not all fault conditions on the DC system can be adequately protected using such a strategy. One such fault condition is the DC arc-fault occurring on the DC systems including the PV system. DC arc-fault can either be a parallel fault (a short-circuit fault) or a series fault (an open-circuit fault).In PV systems, the detection mechanism relies on backfed current to detect these faults. The nature of the faults, especially the series fault contravenes the logic in its detection using current as of the threshold metric. The difficulty in DC arc-fault detection is compounded in PV systems, particularly at low irradiance which also includes night to day transition and partial shading. The fast action of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm to put the system at different MPP operation also imposes additional difficulties in the task of developing accurate reliable DC arc-fault detection techniques.In this thesis, a fault detection and diagnostic tool call the decomposed open-closed alternating sequence (DOCAS) morphological fault detector (MFD) has been proposed for application in fault detection in both AC and DC systems.The DOCAS algorithm uses a decomposed weighted SE to enhance its performance in fault detection. The designed structure of the DOCAS algorithm allows it to be seamlessly applied in fault detection in both AC and DC systems without any structural change.The characteristics of the MM technique make the DOCAS algorithm convenient for the detection and classification of HIFs as well as DC Arc-Faults in PV systems.', 'https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/download-center/books-and-guides/relays/protection-distribution-networks-der'], '\\n  Nepa Archive July - September 2010\\n': ['All Archives\\xa0Disclaimer\\nPrivacy Policy\\nWeb PoliciesFOIA/Privacy Act\\nEmployees Only\\nNo Fear ActVulnerabilities Disclosure Program', 'https://netl.doe.gov/node/9000'], 'Energy metering in LV/MV substations and utilities: Dos and donâ€™ts in installation and operation': ['Energy meters are one of the most important components for monitoring and data acquisition in a power system network with roles in every part of the power system network, from the generation to the commercialized end-users, through multiple transmission and distribution setups. They are primarily used for measuring energy for end-user billing and energy trading purpose.In this article, the focus will be on the mechanism and purpose of energy metering in the power system network along with some essential dos and donâ€™ts for their installation and operation.The article skims through the basic operating principles, types, and general introductions related to energy meters while concentrating primarily on the modern applications and operational details.Table of contents:The vast application of energy meters can be categorized into four major parts of the power system network: Generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization. Based on the type of system and application, the specification and customized functions of the meter differ, though the principle of measurement remains the same.There are myriad sources of energy used for commercial electricity production, ranging from large-scale nuclear energy to more sustainable solar PV energy.Irrespective of the types of sources and the voltage of their production, the energy meter find their use in measuring the total energy released by the source.In some cases like roof-top solar PV systems, the energy meter should be capable of measuring the net energy to account for both incoming and outgoing power depending upon the availability of solar radiation.Similarly, the next major application of the energy meters is in power substations to monitor the energy consumption pattern and sometimes to bill the inter-branch energy exchanges. Then comes the end-users, the customers of utility companies, where the energy meters are employed for billing purposes.Figure 1 shows the four-quadrant operation of energy meters. The first and fourth quadrant operation of meter measures the exported power/energy, whereas the second and third quadrant is for imported power/energy measurement (looking from the utility side).Figure 1 – Four quadrant operation of energy meterThe trivector meters are capable of four-quadrant operation and thus can also be used for net metering or reverse energy recording purposes. This feature of the trivector meters makes them very versatile and useful over a range of applications and also places them in a much higher echelon compared to their electromechanical counterparts, which lack this sort of flexibility.Also, most of the static single-phase meters installed for household purposes are designed for two-quadrant operations (1st and 4th) only to record exported power.Go back to the Contents Table â†‘Substation monitoring and data acquisition have come a long way from their initial days of analog systems.

Solar and wind energy are the top projects the world is embarking on as they can meet future energy requirements, but because they are weather-dependent it is necessary to store the energy generated from these sources.Energy storage systems absorb the excessive energy when generation exceeds predicted levels and supply it back to the grid when generation levels fall short. Electric Storage technologies can be utilized for storing excess power, meeting peak power demands and enhance the efficiency of the country’s power system.These technologies include electrochemical, water electrolysis, compressed air, flywheels and superconducting magnetic energy storage.A battery energy storage system is of three main parts; batteries, inverter-based power conversion system (PCS) and a Control unit called battery management system (BMS). Figure 1 below presents the block diagram structure of BESS.Figure 1 – Main Structure a battery energy storage systemBattery systems are made of different types of rechargeable secondary batteries; batteries that can be charged. The following sub-sections discuss the main features of various types of batteries.These are the oldest and evolved batteries. They consist of a sponge metallic lead anode, a lead-dioxide cathode and a sulfuric acid solution electrolyte. They have numerous favourable traits such as relatively affordable, simplicity of manufacturing thereof, and acceptable life cycle under measured conditions, with a major drawback of using a heavy metal component that makes them harmful to the environment.Due to the high cost associated with them, the limited life-span and low energy density, these batteries are not advantageous for the large-scale applications.They are regarded as the most advanced high-temperature batteries, even though they are relatively new in power system applications. Made of active materials of molten sodium and molten Sulphur, separated by a solid beta alumina ceramic electrolyte. They are favourable to use in relatively large-scale BESS applications; Due to their inexpensive materials, exceptional high energy density, high-efficiency charge/discharge rate, zero maintenance, and long-life specifications.The system must constantly be monitored, to prevent the reaction with the atmosphere, because the interaction of pure sodium with air will result in a disastrous explosion instantly.These batteries are composed from lithium metal or lithium compounds as an anode. They comprise of advantageous traits such as being lightweight, safety, abundancy and affordable material of the negatively charged electrode “cathode” making them an exciting technology to explore. Li-ion batteries offer higher charge densities and have a minimum environmental impact as the lithium oxides can be recycled.They can provide the much-needed power by the network instantaneously due to the response time that’s in the order of milliseconds.Although various BESS technologies exist with relevant benefits, Li-Ion BESS are more promising for large scale application. Therefore, lithium-ion BESS will be considered for this dissertationThe BESS is operational in two modes; the discharging mode to alleviate the utility when the distribution network is down or during the peak-load period time and charging mode to fill the battery bank during an off-peak period or when the network gets restored.Possible ways to discharge the BESS, with the assumption the batteries are fully charged are:The PCS with the help of BMS can supply back-up power with a low distortion AC voltage to the distribution loads via the point of common interconnection via a breaker.The main Control features of PCSs to consider are:The PCSs provide both active and reactive power control functions. When the active/reactive command value exceeds the rated value, active power output takes priority over reactive power. PCS controls the charge/discharge flow of the battery bank as required according to the active/reactive power command from the remote SCADA system.Grid regulations for distribution systems have critical requirements on control functions of PCS, such as low voltage ride-through (LVRT), and the control functions are stored in the control circuit of PCS.The auto-restart function is one of those included in the control circuit, to ensure that the PCS can disconnect from the grid automatically when a grid fault is detected, and also enable for the PCS to restart and reconnect to the grid automatically when the fault is cleared.When the grid fails, the PCS can switch to stand-alone operation to supply the network loads independently, and when the grid recovers the PCS can switch back to normal operation mode to charge/discharge.The PCS provides the rated AC voltage at the rated frequency to load.BESS can be placed at different locations on the power system network to ensure continuity of supply for all customers under any abnormal conditions, the potential locations are; the high voltage side of the substation, Secondary side of the substation or at the secondary side of the mini-substation and act as a residential community focused system.Battery energy storage system may be connected to the high voltage busbar(s) or the high voltage feeders with voltage ranges of 132kV-44 kV; for the reliability of supply, substations upgrades deferral and/or large-scale back-up power supply.Figure 3 depicts a block diagram showing an example of how the BESS can be integrated into the distribution system via the High voltage busbar.Figure 3 – Integrating BESS via the HV busbar block diagramBattery Energy storage system may be connected to the medium voltage busbar(s) or to the medium voltage feeders with voltage ranges of 33kV-1kV; for peak-shifting, substation upgrades deferral, additional capacity, or medium-scale back-up-supply.Figure 4 depicts a block diagram showing an example of how the BESS can be integrated into the distribution system via the medium-voltage busbar.Figure 4 – Integrating BESS via the MV busbar block diagramThe BESS may further be connected as close as possible to the loads, by either being placed by the mini-substations (MV/LV TRFR) or at the customer’s point of connection 400V-230V for residential loads and at the medium voltage feeders with voltage ranges of 33kV-11 kV (depending on the voltage the customer requires) for industrial loads. For voltage support, frequency stabilization, solar smoothing for networks with PV systems, or back-up-supply.Figure 5 depicts a block diagram showing an example of how the BESS can be integrated into the distribution system directly to the loads.Figure 5 – Integration of BESS directly to the loads block diagramFrom the above block diagrams of possible BESS placement, the diagrams shown in figures 10 and 11 are the best fit with regard to the objective of reducing outages in substations and continuously supplying customers, as they offer voltage support, additional capacity and backup-supply. Therefore, both block diagrams will be implemented and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink.Simulink the preliminary and main research to be presented in next chapters, 4 and 5.', 'https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/download-center/books-and-guides/electricity-generation-t-d/battery-energy-storage-systems'], '\\n  Nepa Archive January - March 2010\\n': ['All Archives\\xa0Disclaimer\\nPrivacy Policy\\nWeb PoliciesFOIA/Privacy Act\\nEmployees Only\\nNo Fear ActVulnerabilities Disclosure Program', 'https://netl.doe.gov/node/9010'], 'A few practical ways to determine required reactive energy compensation for a power system': ['This article will shed some light on how adding capacitors gives the distribution system the necessary reactive power to return the power factor to the required level. Capacitors act as a source of reactive energy, which accordingly reduces the reactive power that the energy source must supply. The power factor of the system is therefore improved.In an installation consuming reactive power Q1 (Diagram 1), adding a capacitor bank generating a reactive compensation power Qc (Diagram 2) improves the overall efficiency of the installation. The reactive power Q1 initially supplied by the source is reduced to a new Q2 value (Diagram 3), the φ angle is smaller and the cosine of this angle is improved (moves towards 1).The current consumption is also reduced.Figure 1 – Power trianglePower compensation enables the interests of the user and those of the energy distribution company to be combined, by improving the efficiency of installations through better use of the available power by limiting the consumption of reactive energy that is not only unnecessary and expensive but also a source of overcurrents in conductors.The example below shows how, by “increasing” the power factor from 0.7 to 0.95, for the same active power of 100 kW, the apparent power S (in VA), in comparison to that which actually has to be supplied has been reduced by 35%.Figure 2 – An example of increasing the power factor from 0.7 to 0.95Power factor calculations:When the cos changes from an initial value cos φ1 to a final value cos φ2, as a general rule, the ohmic losses are reduced by: (1 – (cos φ1/cos φ2)²) × 100 as a %Thus changing from a cosφ of 0.7 to 0.95 reduces the losses by 45%. A poor cosφ, therefore, causes voltage drops in the conductors.\\xa0The voltage drop in an electric line can be calculated using the formula: ΔU = I ( R cosφ + L sinφ). The maximum power that can be transmitted in an AC system is calculated using the following formulae:P = U I cosφ for single-phase and P = U I √3 cosφ for three-phase.Improving the cos φ from an initial value cos φ1 to a final value cos φ2, for X (W) power used, releases an additional usable apparent power of S (kVa) = p(kW) × ((1/cos φ1) – (1/cos φ2)). Therefore a 1000 kVa transformer delivering a load of 700 kW with a cosφ of 0.7 is at its maximum load.By improving the cos φ from 0.7 to 0.95, an additional available active power of 250 kW is released.Table of Contents:Figure 3 – Determining compensation based on the cosϕ and the currentsWhere:The final current is reduced so that: Itf = Iti cosφi/cosφfPf/Pi = cosφf / cosφiThe reactive power compensation Qc can be defined as being the difference between the initial power (Qi = U×Irf×sinφi) and the reactive power obtained after compensation (Qf = U×Irf×sinφf):Qc = U × (Iri – Irf)·(sinφi – sinφf)Go back to Contents Table ↑Calculation based on the powers enables the required tan value to be used directly to determine the reactive power compensation to be installed.Figure 4 – Determining compensation based on the tan ϕ and powersThe power compensation is very easy to calculate from the required tan value. The capacitance value in farads is calculated as follows:C = P (tan φi – tan φf) / ωU2Go back to Contents Table ↑When the power compensation (Qc1) is determined correctly, its value must be as close as possible to the reactive power Q to be compensated and the phase shift angle (ϕ’) tends towards 0. If the compensation (Qc2) is greater than the reactive power, the phase-shift angle (φ”) increases, and the apparent power S” increases.The circuit becomes predominantly capacitive. This leads to an increase in the current consumed which defeats the purpose.Figure 5 – Over-compensationOver-compensation also tends to increase the voltage applied to the installation. It must be avoided. It is generally considered that it should not exceed 1.15 times the power to be compensated. The use of power factor controllers and step capacitor banks avoids problems of overcompensation.Figure 6 – Over-compensation currentsOver-compensation (Ic >Ir), increases the apparent current consumed and also increases the voltage applied to the equipment. The illustration of vectors V2S (with over-compensation) and V2 (with appropriate compensation) shows this phenomenon, which must be avoided.Care must be taken when choosing energy compensation.Go back to Contents Table ↑As pricing and metering methods can vary from country to country, only a general process for assessing the need for reactive compensation, using the energy distribution company’s readings or bills, will be described here. Depending on the pricing method, access to the reactive energy consumption (kvarh) may be direct, together with the number of hours to which this value refers. it is then billed proportionately.This is generally the case for high power connections with one or more MV/LV transformers dedicated to the installation.For lower power connections, the reactive power consumption may be indirectly billed by the overconsumption of the apparent power (in VA) that is causes. For a “monitored power” connection, it is then billed according to the amounts by which the subscribed nominal apparent power is exceeded.Go back to Contents Table ↑In general, billing is applied when the tanφ exceeds a certain value (0.4 for example) and also according to time periods (peak times) or seasons (winter). The following calculation method, given for information purposes only, can be used to calculate the capacitor banks to be installed at the supply end of an installation with the regular, repetitive operation.For random or sequenced operation, automatic banks, which switch on according to the load, are recommended so as not to “overcompensate” the installation.The amount of reactive energy billed Erfac will be: Erfac = Er – Ea×tanφ = Er – (0.4×Ea)Power Qc of the capacitors to be installed: Qc = Er/NBhmFor example, if the permitted value of tanφ changes to 0.31, the amount of reactive energy billed Erfac will become:Erfac = Er – Ea×tanφ = Er – (0.31×Ea)Figure 7 – Multifunction digital measurement control unit with reactive energy meteringGo back to Contents Table ↑In this type of supply contract (for example, “yellow tariff” – low power supply – in France), the reactive energy consumption is not shown on the electricity bill. It is charged indirectly, based on the consumption of apparent power in kVA. The distribution company charges a “fixed charge” that depends on the subscribed apparent power. Above this power, the consumer pays penalties. this is the principle of “monitored power”.Reactive energy compensation reduces the fixed charge by reducing the subscribed apparent power. It also enables the amounts over and above this subscribed demand to be limited (billing of the additional kVA over the limit).To determine the reactive power value to be installed, the capital investment costs of the capacitors must be compared with the savings on the fixed charge paid to the distribution company.Nowadays reactive power is only billed for high-power installations, using direct metering (of the reactive power in kvar) or indirect metering (of the apparent power in kVA). Low power installations are billed in kW and therefore their only disadvantage is the limitation of the available current.For responsible energy management with the aim of making better use of resources, and in view of the increasing numbers of receivers with a poor power factor (electronic power supplies, low consumption light bulbs), billing should logically move towards taking reactive power into account, which the next generation of “intelligent” meters will be capable of doing.\\xa0Compensation of small installations will then come into its own.Recommended Reading – Mastering single line and wiring diagrams: Using circuit breaker for MV power factor correctionMastering single line and wiring diagrams: Using circuit breaker for MV power factor correctionGo back to Contents Table ↑An installation usually operates with a subscribed demand S of 160 kVA. The average value of tanφ read is 0.75 (estimated cos 0.8). At peak demand, the power reached is close to the subscribed demand. At its peak, this installation therefore consumes an active power P = UI√3 cosφ = 160 × 0.8 = 128 kW and a reactive power Q = P × tanφ = 128 × 0.75 = 96 kvar.Setting a target value of tanφ at 0.4, it will be possible to reduce the reactive power consumption to Q = P (tan φi – tan φf) = 128 × (0.75 – 0.4) = 45 kvar.This simplified approach may lead to a risk of overcompensation when the installation is not subject to high loads (for example, in the summer). This is why more or less detailed readings, depending on the complexity of the consumption cycles, are always recommended in practice.Further Reading – Five actions to achieve excellent energy savings in old electrical installationsFive actions to achieve excellent energy savings in old electrical installationsGo back to Contents Table ↑Power measurements have changed a great deal due to the increasing complexity of the signals and current waveforms absorbed and as a consequence metering equipment has also advanced, to such a degree that one no longer talks about power measurement but power analysis.Go back to Contents Table ↑Power measurement is a one-off measurement that can provide useful information as to the operating conditions of an installation, but it remains more or less limited depending on the equipment used (direct access to cosφ, tanφ, and harmonic powers), may be marred by errors due to the waveforms and frequencies of the signals, and above all only provides an image at a given moment.Figure 8 – Two-wattmeters methodThe total power in three-phase systems is obtained by adding together the readings from two wattmeters. The tanϕ is calculated the same way: tanϕ = √3·(P1 – P2) / (P1 + P2).In a balanced state, the reactive power Q can be measured using a single wattmeter. It is demonstrated that cos(U13×I1) = cos(π/2 – ϕ). The reactive power in three-phase systems is written Q = √3×P.Figure 9 – A single-wattmeter methodP = U23×I1×cos (U13×I1) = U23×I1Go back to Contents Table ↑For this type of installation, the independent power producer must supply the distribution company with an amount of reactive energy equal to a contractual share of its production of active energy during high-load times and peak periods.In this case, the calculation of the capacitor bank must take the following into account:Go back to Contents Table ↑This table can be used to calculate (based on the power of a receiver in kW) the power of the capacitors to change from an initial power factor to a required power factor. It also gives the equivalence between cosϕ and tanϕ.Table 1 – Power of the capacitors to be installed (in kvar) per kW of loadExample: 200 kW motor – cosϕ = 0.75 – cosϕ to be achieved: 0.93 – Qc = 200 × 0.487 = 98 kvar.Go back to Contents Table ↑Source: Legrand', 'https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/determine-required-reactive-energy-compensation'], 'Integration of renewable energy in smart grid (architecture, communication, and electric vehicles)': ['The smart grid is referred to as the next-generation power grid, with advanced features and a two-way flow of electricity and communication. Those features include demand-side management, fault alarm, advanced metering. The smart grid is expected to provide real-time information and near-instantaneous balance between the supply-side and the demand side.Consumersâ€™ power consumption data is collected and integrated through advanced communication technologies for analyzing the power consumption behaviors and preferences by utilities. The key point for deploying these features is to develop a reliable and efficient communication infrastructure.From Figure 1 we can identify primary substations, working between 110 kV and 20/10 kV in the medium voltage level in the power distribution grid.Normally, the primary substation is recognized as an important component of the distribution infrastructure, which can transform the medium voltage electrical power to low voltage electrical power. The main goal of the secondary substation is to transform the low voltage power to domestic consumption standard power that can be transmitted in local feed lines to terminal power consumers.As shown in Figure 1, the architecture of the power distribution grid is supported by a communications networks, that provides the interaction, information dissemination and interaction among the connected devices.Indeed, the smart grid represents the combination of two infrastructures:The characteristics of reliability, security, interoperability and efficiency of the electrical grid are clearly defined by the employed techniques at the communication level and constrained by reducing environmental impacts and promoting investment growth. Besides the power consumption data transmission, communication techniques also can play a core role in power scheduling, real-time interaction between utility and consumer, and other interaction scenarios.In the traditional smart grid scenario, the grid is expected to estimate the local power grid capacity and other relevant factors in order to optimize the energy usage across the network, making use of existing power plants and micro-generation facilities (e.g. renewable sources at usersâ€™ premises).For this task, it is possible to envisage the usage of wireless communication technologies in the local power distribution domain. The status of the power consumption/ generation pattern for each user is transmitted via the local power distribution control device. Depending on the operating environment, the data could be delivered through routing on multiple wireless access links.Hence, wireless routing path selection represents a relevant challenge in the power distribution scenario and is discussed in some existing research works.This section provides a definition of the considered scenario and a statement of the problem addressed in the paper. As shown in Figure 1, we propose to define the power grid network under 110 kV as the regional power distribution area (RPDA), where the primary substation (including base station and primary data management center) plays the core role of local power management and controls many secondary substations.The power distribution network under 20/10 kV is defined as the local power distribution area (LPDA), where the secondary substation is set as the main controller (including relay station and sub-data management center), and schedules multiple terminal power consumers.In this scenario, the performance of the wireless communication path between the secondary substation located in the new additional LPDA and the primary substation represents a challenge, influencing the possibility of achieving optimal power allocation setups or supporting timely fault detection.From Figure 1, the primary substation schedules power distribution in RPDA, while the secondary substations can be recognized as the terminal nodes. Based on this architecture, we propose to use the following communication system.Â\\xa0The approach is built up based on the RPDA shown in Figure 2.The primary substation, indicated as PS, is set to be the main controller of the RPDA, collecting and transmitting the power consumption and other data between utility and the secondary substations. Meanwhile, the secondary substation can be deployed as smart terminal nodes of PS.In the secondary substation, we deploy one relay station as the wireless communication gate and sub-data management center that can collect and transmit the related data between the primary substation and terminal power consumers.The secondary substation is indicated as R(n), where n is the index associated with each secondary substation. The RPDAâ€™s main controller PS is connected with R(n) by wired power distribution lines. The communication interface is the IEEE 802.22 wireless standards.Renewable energy is introduced into the local architecture to assistent local power re-schedule via R(n) and sub-data management centerâ€™s manipulation, which is produced by household wind turbines and solar generators in this scenario.With the contribution of distributed sub-data management centers, the PS can schedule and scan the global power consumption status within the RPDA and power consumption details from the terminal power consumers through R(n).', 'https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/download-center/books-and-guides/electricity-generation-t-d/renewable-energy-smart-grid'], '\\n  Nepa Archive April - June 2010\\n': ['All Archive\\xa0Note: Several publications listed above are in Portable Document Format (PDF).

FREEDM system is a culmination of high bandwidth digital communication, power electronics and digital communication.It replaces conventional transformer of 60 Hz with solid state transformer (SST) incorporating bidirectional power flow. Solid state transformer is a package of cascaded rectifier, dual active bridge converter and inverter. It has an input of 7.2 kV AC and output of 120 V AC single phase, 208 V AC (3 phase) and 400 V DC.All the DC loads, distributed generation and energy storage devices are connected to the DC link and AC loads are connected to the AC output.To demonstrate the advancement done in FREEDM project, a 1 MW green energy smart hub is under development. The proposed FREEDM loop allows consumers to plug and play energy sources or storage devices from anywhere on the loop.To provide effective power flow, power distribution and fault detection; intelligent energy management (IEM) and intelligent fault detection (IFD) control schemes are incorporated in the FREEDM system.Following Figure 1 shows the schematic layout of the FREEDM system and Figure 2 shows the single line diagram of the FREEDM system. The FREEDM loop is connected to grid and in the case of grid failure, the loop can operate independently.The power flow in the FREEDM system is bi-directional due to the presence of distributed generation (DG) and the conventional protection methodologies must be modified accordingly to detect fault conditions and prevent false tripping. The solid state transformers (SST) have self-protection, which shuts them down during faults when the voltage goes below a certain threshold voltage and it can be adjusted.In the case of a loop system during faults, the voltage of the entire loop plummets to zero or typically a low value. In such a scenario all the SSTâ€™s connected to the loop will shut down due to its self-protection.Hence, it is important to isolate the faulted part of the network from the rest of the system to prevent the shutdown for SSTâ€™s. Pilot differential protection was developed as a solution to the above mentioned problem. It was able to detect faults within quarter of a cycle but it suffered from the problem of communication.Ethernet cable was used as the communication medium to transfer the sampled signals from the current transformers to the central processor. The central processor analyzes the sampled current signals, generates the trip depending up on the system conditions and sends the trip signal back to the breaker.A protection method is developed that could protect looped systems with multiple sources without using any sort of communication. Directional relays with time inverse over current characteristics are coordinated affectively to detect and sectionalize the fault location without affecting the healthy part of the system.This serves as a reliable back-up protection system when the communication system fails.A new pilot protection method is developed using the commercial SEL relays which uses the direction of fault currents to locate the fault. The communication is done using fiber-optic cables and the only data needed to be transferred between the relays is the fault location which is transferred in the form of digital bits.Simulation, hardware implementation and real time digital system (RTDS) validation is explained in the thesis. A protection method is suggested monitoring the sychrophasor measurements, voltage of the system and current during faults.', 'https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/download-center/books-and-guides/relays/protection-schemes-future-energy'], '\\n  Thermal-Mechanical-Chemical Energy Storage Workshop - PROCEEDINGS\\n': ['Welcome to the TMCES Workshop\\nKlaus Brun, Elliott Group\\nTim Allison, SwRIDOE: Demonstration and Commercialization of Innovative Energy Storage Technologies\\nGretchen Kittel, DOE Keynote SpeakerSouthwestern Utility Perspective on Bulk Energy Storage\\nJerald “Chico” Hunter, SRPSmall-scale PHES Demonstration: Solving System Integration and Operation Challenges\\nNatalie Smith, SwRIShort Presentations/Technology UpdatesQualification and Testing of High Strength Materials for Hydrogen Compression\\nDerrick Bauer, Elliott GroupHeat Exchangers for Energy Storage: A Systemic Approach\\nRenaud Le Pierres, HeatricCompression Applications in the Use of Hydrogen for Carbon Reduction\\nRainer Kurz, Solar TurbinesDOE Panel Session (Lead: Joe Stekli, EPRI)\\nMani Gavvalapalli\\nEric Miller\\nSamuel Bockenhauer\\nAvi ShultzDeep Decarbonization with Zero-emissions Power and Industrial Heat up to 1500˚C\\nJustin Briggs, AntoraUpdates on Hydrogen as a Means for Long Duration Energy Storage for the Power Industry\\nPeter Luessen, MHI\\xa0Welcome Day 2, Recap Day 1/Breakout Session Guidance\\nTim Allison, SwRIRepowering Coal Plants as Pumped Thermal Energy Storage\\nBenjamin Bollinger, MaltaThermal Batteries: Concept and R&D Progress\\nAsegun Henry, MITAdvanced Compressed Air Energy Storage’s (A-CAES’s) Unique Long Duration Energy Storage Value Proposition\\nCurtis VanWalleghem, HydrostorLong-Duration Energy Storage Council – Global TMCES Collaboration\\nMichael Geyer, LDES-CPanel Session – Creating Projects that Take T-M-C Storage to the Next Step in Commercialization (Lead: Tim Allison, SwRI)\\nJohn Marra – Siemens Energy\\nMarcus Martin – Martin Energy Group\\nDiane Fischer – Kiewit\\nKlaus Brun – Elliott Group\\nJoshua Schmitt – SwRIIndustrial Heat Pumps – Flexible Infrastructure for an Electrified Future\\nChristopher Fraughton, MAN Energy Solutions USAEnergy Storage Opportunities in New York State\\nWilliam Acker, NY-BEST\\xa0Disclaimer\\nPrivacy Policy\\nWeb PoliciesFOIA/Privacy Act\\nEmployees Only\\nNo Fear ActVulnerabilities Disclosure Program', 'https://netl.doe.gov/22TMCES-proceedings'], 'Five actions to achieve excellent energy savings in old electrical installations': ['Not all existing electrical installations lack energy efficiency, but most of them do. Especially if they were built 15-20 years ago and older. Although it is generally acknowledged that substantial energy savings are possible in most existing installations, the process of achieving these savings is more complicated than it may seem. So, what could we do about it? This article will try to explain the process.Suggesting and implementing alternative lower consumption solutions (motors, high-efficiency transformers, energy compensation, low consumption lighting, etc.) and also installing regulation and automation systems (electrical control units, PLCs, intelligent management, etc.) are investments that have to be validated and justified by diagnostics based on relevant sets of readings requiring the necessary measuring apparatus (metering, instrumentation, recording of consumptions and events, etc.).The “energy efficiency project” methodology must leave nothing to chance.Table of contents:The initial process consists of attempting to understand how the electricity is consumed, irrespective of whether or not this is the only source of energy.What are the largest functions? How is the electricity used?These parts are:Its description must be intelligent, balanced and always prudent. We all forget to turn off a light sometimes. So while some types of behaviour may seem surprising, it is the cause we must investigate and not the consequence that must be pointed out.The descriptive summary must first and foremost delineate and identify the main areas made up by the principal buildings (workshops, warehouses, storerooms, etc.) or main sectors of the entity in question which are intended on the whole for a main function: manufacturing, offices, warehouses, etc.Ideally sources which give rise to energy metering should be superimposed over these areas, with for example a source item or better still a consumption history. Failing this, appropriate measuring apparatus must be available at least during the diagnostic phase.The surface areas, number of floors, number of people present, and possibly other details such as the year of construction, and any element relating to the energy aspect (glazed areas, doors, structural components, etc.) must be specified in the descriptive summary.Go back to contents ↑Although it is right that heating and air conditioning account for a very large part of the energy consumption of buildings, in particular residential buildings (approximately 40% in Europe), other energy-consuming processes in the industrial field and also the commercial field may also be improved:All the activities in each area must be assessed in terms of electrical consumption. The main activity and secondary activities must be distinguished. The secondary activities may often be less secondary than they seem: for example a cafeteria that consumes more energy than the kitchens.The analysis of the energy company’s bills will give an overview of the energy consumption (active and reactive) and the share of the fixed items (standing charge and costs). In some cases, the customer also has access to a consumption history and can therefore ascertain the power consumption profile according to the time (measured in 10 min intervals) or even the season.These two pieces of information will give an initial indication which will of course be general, but will already enable correlation with the operation of some high consumption items.Go back to contents ↑Unlike the first step which involved the description, the second step of the preparatory phase will consist of designating the main functions or load items and relating to each of them the devices or applications involved in that item.Of course this is not the simplest approach, because it will be necessary to examine all the applications with sufficient precision, but without getting lost in too much detail.Choices, sometimes arbitrary, must be made to select only high consumption applications or those which would a priori be wasteful.A few preliminary measurements could be necessary at this stage in order to decide on the advantage of carrying out a more in-depth diagnosis of a particular function. The relative share of each of these load items must then be allocated to each of the previously defined main areas. Some load items may match one area fairly exactly, while for others the area identified may have numerous functions whose relative share must assessed.This is usually the role of the power analysis prior to a project, but in the case of an existing installation, it is the measurement that will provide information on this exact share.The process shown in the example in the block diagram on the previous page can be used to determine the relative shares of each of the functions by area or by building. These shares must be related to the actual measured consumptions (see block diagram). It is thus possible to establish relationships between the applications and the main consumptions.In the example described, it is for example important to understand why building B has a relative heating consumption share of 70% whereas building C, with an identical surface area, only has a 20% relative share.Of course, numerous other questions must also be asked:Question № 1 – Comparison of the actual energy consumptions in kWh.Question № 2 – Understanding of why individual air conditioning units are installed in this building.Question № 3 – Is the solar gain perhaps much higher in building C? This could explain the lower heating demand but, as a counterpart, the cooling requirement.At this stage in the considerations, consultation of the consumptions according to the times of year could be revealing.Question № 4 – Should better use be made of the solar gain, which is useful in winter but inconvenient in summer?Individual air conditioning units are certainly not the right answer. Deflectors, awnings, a centralised air conditioning system or even changes to the hours during which the premises are occupied are all hypotheses that should be explored.Question № 5 – The assumption that a large part of the heat is generated by the lighting (50% of the consumption of building C) must be precisely quantified.If all these questions do not provide satisfactory answers, it may be necessary to look for them in the characteristics of the buildings.Question № 6 – Is the insulation of building B adequate?\\xa0Numerous causes can be investigated: aren’t there abnormally high losses in the actual functioning of building B?The doors opening onto the loading bays are often open. It could be possible to consider asking users to close them, but if this has to be said ten times a day, the effectiveness of the measure is likely to be uncertain. Other solutions such as air curtains or automatic closing systems should therefore be considered.Although evidence may appear on simple reading of the available consumption figures, it must be remembered that many points will only appear when additional information is collected: operating cycles, human occupation, local climatology, characteristics of the buildings, etc. which must be cross-referenced with the measurements taken on-site.The exact relative share of the functions/applications described in this diagram cannot generally be completed until after measurements have been taken.Go back to contents ↑The lighting on constant power light sources is measured using a luxmeter.\\xa0 The lamp meter is a device that also has memory functions. It is installed in the immediate vicinity of each point of light to be evaluated. It has an optical sensor that records the periods during which the lighting is operational.When using this, the power of the lighting equipment (assumed to be constant throughout the whole measurement period) must also be measured.The specific energy consumptions can be ascertained by multiplying the power by the recorded durations.Go back to contents ↑The presence meter is a very compact standalone electronic recorder fitted with an infrared detection module. Each time someone enters the sensor’s detection area the event will be stored in the memory: detection start and end date and time.This device provides precise information on the traffic and human presence in a given area.Go back to contents ↑Small standalone thermometers are available that carry out repetitive measurements (for example, every two minutes) and calculate the average per period. The values are stored in the memory.More sophisticated devices such as measurement control units can acquire a wide variety of data, including the temperature, over hundreds of points. Their installation and connection are more complicated, but some can now be interfaced on a local area network, Internet or even the smartphone.Go back to contents ↑This device is used for measuring power. Current digital models can be used to access all values: P, Q, S, U; I, cos ϕ, PF (power factor), etc., and even harmonic and frequency values. Some even carry out direct energy calculations by integrating the measurement time.These are referred to as power analysers.Go back to contents ↑This performs some or all of the functions of the power analyser but can record values measured over long periods.It produces histograms which are very useful since, as well as giving details of instantaneous values, they can be used to establish precise relationships between consumption and events.Go back to contents ↑The collection of large quantities of measurements may cause dispersion and considerable difficulty of interpretation. Paradoxically the huge data acquisition capacities of today’s devices mean that it is not always easy to sort out what is relevant and adequate.For lighting, power per unit of surface area could be considered (see example), or daytime/night-time ratio. Different buildings could also be compared on this basis.Table 1 – Example of analysis for lighting The presentation of consumption according to periods of occupation is often very useful and could be a quick source of savings. In other cases, such as heating, a seasonal profile would be useful for comparing potential alternative resources such as solar energy.Without going into detail in this table, several striking anachronisms can be quickly seen:Apart from the potential savings, this type of presentation also confirms certain shortcomings. The external entry lighting, apart from operating in full daylight, also has the drawback of being ineffective. The very low power allotted to it confirms this.There are many possible interpretations of the results. The ability to organise the project and its chances of success will depend on selecting the correct interpretation.Go back to contents ↑Four essential questions to be asked:One may imagine that it would therefore be possible to fulfil the same requirements with much less energy, and with a lower power demand. This very innovative approach has already been successfully applied to other types of buildings.The consideration and questioning phase, which must lead to the examination of existing information, is essential.Go back to contents ↑Following on logically from the diagnostic phase, the implementation phase will be based on the analysis report whose relevance and readability will have a significant influence on the decisions that are taken on actions.Download an example of building energy monitoring and analysis report:Download PDFGo back to contents ↑At this stage, the decision can be taken to either do nothing or to undertake improvement work. There are often as many possibilities for improvement as there is information collected, to such a point that there is a real risk of trying undertake too many things at once, just as there is a risk of confusion over the expected effectiveness of an action.It is therefore advisable to give an overall picture of the achievable improvement by subject and the associated cost involved.Table 2 – Example of presentation(1) In comparison with a reference consumption which is to be specified (for example, average over the last 3 years) (2) Low, medium or high, or if possible a more precise valueDecisions can then be taken on various actions. They must be connected with a reference subject. Plainly, low cost operations should be undertaken quickly, even if the resulting savings are small.Go back to contents ↑Apart from talking about new or renewable sources, positive energy or fantastic efficiency levels, we must not forget that saving means first and foremost not losing.The “war on waste” must go on all year round…Here ABB explains the importance of high motor efficiency and MEPS (Minimum Energy Performance Standards), which sets the mandatory minimum efficiency levels for electric motors.Go back to contents ↑The recommended actions should be presented with a precise description of the application in question and the reference subject as just mentioned, supporting an energy cost justification based on the measurement phase, and proposing a replacement or improvement solution.\\xa0The investment cost, and if required the maintenance cost, together with the resulting potential energy savings and cost savings must be presented in the form of a financial analysis with a cost-benefit calculation.If the benefits and savings are identified, specific conditions for success may be specified. These may be for example:The recommended actions can\\xa0 be presented together with the diagnostic report, but as a general rule it will be preferable to keep the two phases (diagnostic and improvement project) separate, as they will require different skills.Go back to contents ↑Having implemented the recommended actions, the effectiveness of the result can only be guaranteed if it is measured and checked. This is a prerequisite for contractual obligations.On small installations, measurement devices can be simple (index meters) and readings can be taken manually, but as soon as the size or number of consumption points increase, full energy management systems combining measurement and management are more suitable.These use appropriate computer software which makes it possible to directly establish load profiles, consumption curves and carry out any required processing.Go back to contents ↑Source: Power balance and the choice of power supply solutions by Legrand', 'https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/energy-savings-old-electrical-installations'], '\\n  Energy Storage for Fossil Fuel Energy Systems\\n': ['\\xa0ApproachThe Energy Storage program will develop a comprehensive strategy to expand FE’s current portfolio of technologies and programs to include an FE Energy Storage Technology Research Program in order to continue to extract maximum economic value from the Nation’s fossil-fueled energy system assets.High-Level Program Goals Include:Program Areas of Interest:Energy Storage will be essential to a resilient and flexible electricity network through storage methods at the generation site such as:DOE Energy Storage Grand Challenge:\\nLearn more about the new grand challenge organized by the DOE here.

To achieve this goal, the problem formulation in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) program under the Economic and the Improvement energy efficiency constraints, will be formed.And the objective function of this problem is to maximize the benefit to fulfill the growth in demand.Talking about the distribution network, distribution transformers are the second largest loss-making component after lines. However, the modern technology can reduce losses by up to 80%. And if we switch the worldwide electricity network to the high efficiency transformer, the potential of energy saving is estimated to be at least 200 TWh.This amount of potential energy saving is not only technically advantageous, but also brings the environmental benefit. Up to now four largest economies countries in the world including Australia, China, India and Japan are the most advanced in program of the potential energy saving in distribution transformer.While at the beginning there are seven members: Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, and the USA who are willing to improve the transformer in their T&D system.So in this project, a case study for Spain will be created. In the base year of investment, the number and power installed of three different types of transformer will be given.

It reduces the power consumption and thus its cost, enables optimum use of installations by preventing them being oversized, and more generally it improves the quality of energy systems.Contents:Inductive loads, typically motors and transformers, and also certain types of lighting with ballast, as well as welding equipment or induction heating, have the particular feature of operating with the help of a magnetic field. Some of the power needed to generate this magnetic field is not converted into heat or work.Very long lines (by inductive storage) and also static converters (controlled rectifiers, Ac power controllers, etc.) can also consume unnecessary energy by phase-shifting the current behind the fundamental voltage.Unlike the compensation of inductive circuits, compensation of predominantly capacitive circuits requires the use of inductances to absorb the reactive energy that is produced.This situation is found on distribution circuits (very long lines, cable networks), often when there is a low load on the circuits. new installations that use numerous electronic power supplies (data centres) may also have this particular feature.As well as avoiding feeding the energy back onto the system, compensation of an installation with too high a capacitance is necessary to limit the transient overcurrents and overvoltages that could occur when such loads are switched on, and to avoid self-excitation of synchronous motors.The harmful consequences of reactive power on transmission lines described previously is also found in installations:Go back to contents ↑Over-compensation (Ic >Ir) increases the apparent current consumed and also increases the voltage applied to the equipment. The illustration of vectors V2S (with over-compensation) and V2 (with appropriate compensation) shows this phenomenon, which must be avoided.Care must be taken when choosing energy compensation.Go back to contents ↑Industrial systems are generally parallel RLC circuits. However each branch may itself make up other complex series or series/parallel systems. All three elements share the same supply voltage.The total current it is equal to the vectorial sum of the currents of all three elements: it = iR + iL + iCThe impedances of the inductive, resistive and capacitive branches of the circuit are respectively:ZL = Lω ZR = R ZC = –1/CωThe impedance of this type of circuit is equal to the inverse of the sum of the inverses of each impedance:This equation shows that the impedance part due to the capacitance and the inductance may tend towards 0 if Lω = -1/cω. This is the phenomenon of resonance (or more precisely, anti-resonance, as UL and UC are in anti-phase) which occurs at certain frequencies corresponding to an angular frequency:Due to the equality Lω = –1/cω, the impedance of the circuit is reduced at the resistive branch R. the current may then suddenly increase to dangerous or even destructive values.The power of each branch is written as follows:Go back to contents ↑The phase shifts between currents in parallel RLC circuits and the powers associated with each of the impedances that make up these circuits can be represented by Fresnel current and power diagrams, which show the concepts of phase shift (ϕ) and power factor (PF or λ).The power factor characterises the ratio of the active (useful power) power to the apparent power (sum of the active power and the reactive power).When the currents and voltages are totally sinusoidal, the current diagrams and power diagrams are similar and the power factor (PF or λ) is identical to the cosine ϕ of the displacement angle between the U and I vectors.Go back to contents ↑The below current diagram can be used to locate the vectors representing each of the three components of a parallel RLC circuit.Where:The voltage u of the source is considered to be the reference. It should be noted that in this example, the value of IL (reactive current in the inductance) is greater than that of IC (reactive current in the capacitance). The ϕ angle is negative.Adding capacitors will thus make it possible to supply the reactive current necessary for the compensation of IL.The following relationships are established based on this diagram:Go back to contents ↑In the diagram below, the value of IC (reactive current in the capacitance) is greater than that of IL (reactive current in the inductance) and the ϕ angle is positive.To compensate for the reactive current IC being too high, shunt reactors must be used. This must not be confused with the insertion of inductances in series with the capacitors, which is intended to limit the risk of resonance.The 2nd diagram is a simplified representation that is often used, in which the sum of IL and IC is written Ir (for reactive).If there are non-linear loads an additional power, referred to as distorting power, is introduced and the equality of the ratios between the power and the sinusoidal currents is no longer verified.Only measurement of the power rms values will give the power factor.Go back to contents ↑Additivity of reactive powers installations are made up of numerous groups of loads connected in parallel (A, B, C, etc. in the example below).The current/voltage phase shift and the total current it consumed by these groups of loads are the result of adding the current vectors. This is a somewhat complicated mathematical approach.However, the reactive power is easy to calculate from the arithmetical sum of the various powers of each load:The Fresnel diagram of the group of receivers A and B demonstrates the relationship between vectors It, I1 and I2 associated with the sinusoidal values it, i1 and i2 respectively:It × sin ϕ = I1 × sin ϕ1 + I2 × sin ϕ2Multiplying the two members of the equation by U (common voltage in parallel group), gives:U × It × sin ϕ = U × I1 × sin ϕ1 + U × I2 × sin ϕ2The reactive power of the group of receivers is equal to the sum of the reactive powers of each receiver, i.e. Q = Q1 + Q2This rule, which can be generalised to any group of receivers supplied with the same sinusoidal voltage is known as Boucherot’s theorem (Q = ΣQn).Go back to contents ↑The two representations above are possible as the power has no sign. however, and by analogy with the current diagram, the first representation is preferable.Where:For linear loads:Go back to contents ↑The tangent ϕ characteristic is widely used for its practicality. The closer it is to zero the less reactive energy is consumed. The advantage of this expression is that it characterizes the balance of the exchange of reactive energy between the supply source and the consuming installation.Thus, if the power compensation is too high, the reactive power Q becomes positive again and the tangentϕ once again moves away from zero.The permitted values for tanϕ vary according to the country and the supply contract. For example, in France, the value above which billing is triggered (according to tarif period) is 0.4 (corresponding to a cos of 0.93) seen from the High Voltage metering side, which also incorporates the reactive consumption of the connection transformer.The separation of electrical energy transmission and distribution companies leads to consideration of the possibility of lowering the tan value to 0.2.The search for additional savings by penalizing the reactive energy comes up against the technical requirement of reducing the resonance frequency of installations caused by too many capacitors.These are all contradictory elements that show that it is important to have a good knowledge of the characteristics of the installation and its receivers when implementing any compensation project.Go back to contents ↑Source: Electrical energy supply by Legrand', 'https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/theory-reactive-energy-compensation'], 'DC versus AC power transmission with reference to bulk-energy transfer': ['High voltage transmission systems has a dual purpose, i.e. system interconnection and bulk-energy transfer. With reference to system interconnection, the need to operate the whole system in perfect synchronism often prevents the transfer of power by alternating current.The reasons are following:The economic power ratings of such interconnections are often small in relation to the installed capacity of the systems to be interconnected. In such cases an AC tie line may not be able to cope with the power flow and stability control problems.An alternative DC interconnection provides a fast and flexible power flow control, regardless of the conditions in the AC systems, and can provide stability improvement for the two interconnected systems.This technical article/guide requires a Premium Membership.

The most frequent harmonic sources are linked to the use of electric arcs (welding, arc furnaces, discharge lamps, etc.) and to magnetic machines.Power electronics (converters, variable control units, power supplies, ballasts, induction heating) is also a significant source of harmonics in the industrial field.An additional source has recently appeared with the increased use of the following products amongst the general public and in the commercial area, which are all low-power devices but are in widespread use: computers, printers, televisions and small applicators that all have common electrical switching mode power supplies.The new forms of “low consumption” economic lighting are also new sources of harmonics.One new feature: distorting power that is due to harmonics must be calculated in any electrical assessment going forward.For these latter devices, apart from creating additional losses through hysteresis due to the increase in frequency, the presence of harmonics with higher frequency than that of the network leads to a decrease in the impedance of the capacitors, which results in overload currents and even destruction in the event of resonance.Depending on the “total harmonics” present, suitable compensation solutions will have to be implemented, or solutions that include suitable protective devices from the risk of resonance with harmonics.The design of the installation considered and calculation of the elements present which may be completed using on-site measurements will be essential in getting rid of resonance risk, the causes and consequences.Contents:This distortion corresponds to unnecessary power consumption at multiple frequencies of the fundamental frequency. The distorted current matches the superposition of the various harmonic orders.Harmonic interference can be characterized using\\xa0several methods:Where:This magnitude is used to assess voltage or current\\xa0distortion using a unique number. In practice, the total\\xa0harmonic distortion is usually expressed as a percentage by limiting the range (most often order 25, or 40\\xa0or 50 in the event of high pollution).With harmonics present, the actual apparent power\\xa0represents the geometric sum of the voltage/current\\xa0products of each harmonic order.The effective value l of the current is determined by\\xa0the contribution of the currents of each harmonic\\xa0order. The apparent power due to orders higher than 1 (fundamental order) constitutes the harmonic power or\\xa0distorting power D.The active power P and reactive power Q are linked to\\xa0the current of the 1st fundamental order. The distorting power is linked to the harmonic orders\\xa0higher than 1.The distorting power D increases the apparent power\\xa0s and damages the power factor λ.In the event of very high harmonic power, the\\xa0critical frequencies must be eliminated or\\xa0minimized using suitable filters. there are\\xa0several technological possibilities: passive,\\xa0active, hybrid.3 points important to note:The THD does not provide any information on the spectral contents of the signal, and therefore does not\\xa0constitute adequate means for calculating filtering methods in relation to resonance risks.On the other hand,\\xa0it does give an interesting indication of the installation’s degree of pollution and of the risks incurred.The voltage THDu characterises the voltage wave distortion.The voltage THDi characterises the current wave distortion.It is, therefore,\\xa0important to know the exact nature (the order) of the harmonics and, in particular, the potential part of\\xa0order 3 which is often predominant. Use of harmonics compensation devices is recommended. This becomes essential beyond 50% THDi.Go back to contents ↑The harmonics circulate preferentially in the capacitors at the risk or overloading and destroying them. The impedance of a capacitor is inversely proportional to the frequency (Zc = 1/cω).The more the frequency increases (the case with harmonics), the more the impedance decreases.Introducing capacitors, however, also has the effect of\\xa0changing the impedance of the installation compared\\xa0with that of the source, therefore risking resonance\\xa0phenomenon occurring between the two, which is all\\xa0the more easily attained given the fact of the frequency\\xa0increase, i.e. the case where harmonic currents are\\xa0present.The amplification factor is used to calculate\\xa0the resonance risk according to the power compensation QC compared with the source power ST (or of its\\xa0short-circuit power SSC), with this factor also dependent on the active power load P.These two factors are used to balance the choice in a\\xa0practical way through assessing the risk of harmonic\\xa0pollution of the installation SH/ST compared with the\\xa0power compensation used QC/ST.The installation’s total harmonic distortion\\xa0level and the compensation rate are two\\xa0essential factors in choosing capacitor type.\\xa0The more distorting loads incorporated in\\xa0the installation and/or the more significant\\xa0the compensation compared with the power\\xa0supply, the higher the risk of harmonic\\xa0overload of the capacitors.Solutions that incorporate\\xa0protective devices are therefore required.Care should be taken when installing\\xa0compensation capacitors in low-power\\xa0installations with several distorting loads\\xa0(shops, offices, etc.)Go back to contents ↑The harmonic currents circulate naturally or “go back\\xa0up” from their source to the circuits which show the\\xa0lowest impedance. In theory, most of these (Ihs) are therefore sent back\\xa0towards the source and the network by crossing the\\xa0power supply transformer.In practice, harmonic currents (Ihu) are also fed back\\xa0into the other load circuits of the installation: mutual pollution between harmonic generators and sensitive\\xa0reactors is therefore possible.An installation’s sensitivity to the harmonics that it\\xa0generates is of course linked to the quantity of these\\xa0harmonics, and especially to the impedance characteristics of the installation in relation to the source.Go back to contents ↑If ZS << ZU, the voltage Va = e, the source and the upstream system acts as one ideal voltage source. The network is “immensely powerful” compared with the installation to be supplied.Frequency behaviour is linear, i.e. the contribution of the different harmonic orders does not change the voltages VA and VB in the mathematical application of the superposition theorem known as “de Parseval”:This same concept is used to link the harmonic pollution probability with the power of the source and the polluting element ratio. The inequality is transposed to the power in the form:SSC >> SUWhere:The same approach has been shown to the resonance\\xa0risk between source and installation.Go back to contents ↑The installation of capacitors changes the harmonics\\xa0circulation.\\xa0The capacitors’ impedance is lower than that of the\\xa0source when the frequency increases.The behaviour of the entire source/installation\\xa0is changed and varies according to the harmonics frequency.From a mathematical point of view, the superposition theorem no longer applies and calculation of the\\xa0contribution of each harmonic order would show that\\xa0impedance ZU decreases with the frequency.On the\\xa0equivalent wiring diagram, the voltage VA differs from e.A significant Ihc part of the harmonic currents is diverted towards the capacitor.\\xa0There is a risk therefore of the latter being overloaded\\xa0or destroyed.Go back to contents ↑With significant harmonics present (SH/ST: 25 to 35%),\\xa0installation of an inductance in series with the capacitor (type with anti-resonance reactor) can be used\\xa0to increase the impedance of the latter to harmonic\\xa0frequencies and to move the resonance frequency of\\xa0the LC filter thus created below the frequencies due\\xa0to the main harmonic currents.This technique has its\\xa0limits. It partially eliminates the harmonic currents,\\xa0but a part continues to revert to the source.Typical tuning frequency values:Example of the layout of an anti-resonance reactor in series\\xa0with the capacitor. The order-5 harmonic showing a resonance\\xa0risk is stopped and is not tuned to the capacitor.It is not eliminated, however, and continues to circulate in the\\xa0installation, risking other receivers becoming polluted.The two\\xa0components are sized in such a way that they resonate\\xa0at the unwanted frequency, thus leading the current\\xa0to run through the filter. As such different “tuned”\\xa0filters can each be installed on the frequency to be\\xa0eliminated (250 Hz for order 5, 350 Hz for order 7).The\\xa0advantage of these solutions is the simplicity and the\\xa0limited cost.The filter absorbs the harmonic and prevents resonance\\xa0starting with the compensation capacitor.Depending on the\\xa0position of the filter in the installation it allows the circulation\\xa0of the “captured” harmonic to be decreased. the filter must\\xa0be sized so as to absorb currents that may be high where resonance occurs.Go back to contents ↑The passive filter\\xa0is made up of an\\xa0inductance in series\\xa0with a capacitor. The\\xa0LC cell made up in this way is connected to a\\xa0given (order) harmonic\\xa0frequency.Its installation in parallel does not limit the power field. It is a solution that is completely compatible with the\\xa0power compensation from the moment that an analysis\\xa0of the harmonic content of the installation has been\\xa0carried out.The active filter\\xa0analyses the\\xa0harmonics that\\xa0circulate around\\xa0the installation in\\xa0real time (current harmonics) or that\\xa0are present at the\\xa0terminal of a sensitive\\xa0receiver (voltage harmonics).It adapts\\xa0according to the load but has a higher cost and its\\xa0power remains limited.This is an association of two systems, passive and\\xa0active, which is used to extend the power area.Harmonics filtration is effective as long as a suitable\\xa0system is chosen, which means that analysis and\\xa0prior measurements are essential. if these are not\\xa0completed then malfunctions are inevitable.Go back to contents ↑Reference // Electrical energy supply by Legrand', 'https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/harmonics-energy-compensation'], '\\n  PROCEEDINGS - FY22 FECM SPRING R&D PROJECT REVIEW MEETING - CROSSCUTTING RESEARCH (ENERGY STORAGE)\\n': ['Opening Remarks\\nRichard Dennis, Technology Manager, Advanced Turbines and Supercritical CO2 Power Cycles Programs, National Energy Technology LaboratoryProgram Overview\\nBhima Sastri.

It is also defined as, “a device employing the principle of mutual induction to convert variations of current in a primary circuit into variations of voltage and current in a secondary circuit”. A transformer may have more than two conductors or windings.Definitions are given here with some overlap due to varying sources.Power transformers are used in transmission network of higher voltages for step-up and step down application (400 kV, 200 kV, 110 kV, 66 kV, 33kV) and are generally rated above 200MVA…The high voltages reduce current and therefore I2R energy losses as heat.Installed in distribution substations located near load centers, these reduce transmission line high voltage to 5 to 220 KV for local distribution ending at service transformers.These are located close to customer’s loads, and reduce distribution voltage to split phase 120/240V (in the US) for final delivery to the customer loads. Power systems also use transformers for less raw power applications.Small transformers used in power supplies and electronic circuits. These can also be\\xa0used for impedance matching, filters, and electrical isolation of different parts of a circuit.Some of the specific transformer types, including non-power applications, include:Transformer in which part of the winding is common to both primary and secondary\\xa0circuits.An autotransformer has only a single winding, which is tapped at some point along the winding.\\xa0AC or pulsed DC power is applied across a portion of the winding, and a higher (or lower) voltage is produced\\xa0across another portion of the same winding.Autotransformers are commonly used as spark coils in\\xa0automotive engines, and as high-voltage flyback transformers in television sets and computer monitors…A common configuration provided for 120 V as input and percentages of that voltage as high as about 110%.

These are sometimes referred to as full power systems as they are autonomous.Smaller power systems could be made of part or sections of a larger, full system. Figure 1 shows several elements that operate together and are connected to a power supplying network.Power systems that are supplied by an external electricity source or that produce (by conversion from other sources) electricity and convey it to a larger grid are called partial power systems.The power systems that are of interest for our purposes are the large scale, full power systems that span large distances and have been deployed over decades by power companies.Generation is the production of electricity at power stations or generating units where a form of primary energy is converted into electricity. Transmission is the network that moves power from one part of a country or a region to another. It is usually a well-interconnected infrastructure in which multiple power lines link different substations, which change voltage levels, offering enhanced redundancy.Distribution finally delivers the power (we could say locally when compared to the transmission system) to the final loads (a majority of which are supplied at low voltage) via intermediate steps at which the voltage is converted down (transformed) to lower levels.The distribution system ends up at the energy consumption points or loads where power is used for its final purpose.There are parts of the world in which the deregulation and privatization of the industry has already completely changed the industry landscape, while in others the impact is still to be seen.Power plants convert the energy stored in the fuel (mainly coal, oil, natural gas, enriched uranium) or renewable energies (water, wind, solar) into electric energy.Conventional modern generators produce electricity at a frequency that is a multiple of the rotation speed of the machine. Voltage is usually no more than 6 to 40 kV. The power output is determined by the amount of steam driving the turbine, which depends mainly on the boiler. The voltage of that power is determined by the current in the rotating winding (i.e., the rotor) of the synchronous generator.The output is taken from the fixed winding (i.e., the stator). The voltage is stepped up by a transformer, normally to a much higher voltage. At that high voltage, the generator connects to the grid in a substation.Traditional power plants generate ac power from synchronous generators that provide three-phase electric power, such that the voltage source is actually a combination of three ac voltage sources derived from the generator with their respective voltage phasors separated by phase angles of 120°.Wind turbines and mini hydro units normally employ asynchronous generators, in which the waveform of the generated voltage is not necessarily synchronized with the rotation of the generator.DG refers to generation that connects into the distribution system, as opposed to conventional centralized power generation systems.Small generators are constantly improving in terms of cost and efficiency, becoming closer to the performance of large power plants.Power from generation plants is carried first through transmission systems, which consist of transmission lines that carry electric power at various voltage levels. A transmission system corresponds to a networked, meshed topology infrastructure, connecting generation and substations together into a grid that usually is defined at 100 kV or more.The electricity flows over high-voltage (HV) transmission lines to a series of substations where the voltage is stepped down by transformers to levels appropriate for distribution systems.Preferred AC rms voltage levels are internationally standardized in IEC 60038:2009 as:In the case of systems having a nominal voltage between 100V and 1,000V inclusive, 230/400V is standard for three-phase, four-wire systems (50 Hz or 60 Hz) and also 120/208V for 60 Hz. For three-wire systems, 230V between phases is standard for 50 Hz and 240V for 60 Hz. For single-phase three-wire systems at 60 Hz, 120/240V is standard.Medium voltage (MV) as a concept is not used in some countries (e.g., United Kingdom and Australia), it is “any set of voltage levels lying between low and high voltage” and the problem to define it is that the actual boundary between MV and HV levels depends on local practices.In Europe, overhead transmission lines are used in open areas such as interconnections between cities or along wide roads within the city. In congested areas within cities, underground cables are used for electric energy transmission. The underground transmission system is environmentally preferable but has a significantly higher cost.Transmission lines are deployed with three wires along with a ground wire. Virtually all ac transmission systems are three-phase transmission systems.Distribution segment is widely recognized as the most challenging part of the smart grid due to its ubiquity. Voltage levels of 132 (110 in some places) or 66 kV are usual HV levels that can be found in (European) distribution networks. Voltages below that (e.g., 30, 20, 10 kV) are commonly found in MV distribution networks.MV grid topologies can be classified in three groups:Radial lines are used to connect primary substations (PSs) with secondary substations (SSs), and the SSs among them. These MV lines or “feeders” can be used exclusively for one SS or can be used to reach several of them. Radial systems keep central control of all the SSs.These radial topologies show a tree-shaped configuration when they grow in complexity. They are a less expensive topology to develop, operate, and maintain, but they are also less reliable.This is a fault-tolerant topology to overcome the weakness of radial topology when there is a disconnection of one element of the MV line that interrupts electricity service (outage) in the rest of the connected substations. A ring topology is an improved evolution of the radial topology, connecting substations to other MV lines to create redundancy.Independently of the physical configuration, the grid is operated radially, but on the event of a failure in a feeder, other elements are maneuvered to reconfigure the grid in such a way that outages are avoided.Networked topology consists of primary and secondary substations connected through multiple MV lines to provide a variety of distribution alternatives. Thus, the reconfiguration options to overcome faults are multiple, and in the event of failure, alternative solutions may be found to reroute electricity.LV grids present more complex and heterogeneous topologies than MV grids. The exact topology of LV systems depends on the extension and specific features of the service area, the type, number and density of points of supply (loads), country-specific and utility-specific operating procedures, and range of options in international standards.An SS typically supplies electricity to one or several LV lines, with one or multiple MV-to-LV transformers at the same site. LV topology is typically radial, having multiple branches that connect to extended feeders, but there are also cases of networked grids and even ring or dual-fed configurations in LV networks.LV lines are typically shorter than MV lines, and their characteristics are different depending on the service area.Reference // Telecommunication Networks for the Smart Grid by Alberto Sendin (Purchase hardcover from Amazon)', 'https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/electric-power-systems']}\n",
